# Multispectral-Image-Sementic-Segmentation

Project Details -> [Project Report](https://github.com/milannzz/Multispectral-Image-Sementic-Segmentation/blob/main/FinalReport.pdf)

The objective of this project was to develop a land use/land cover classifier using machine
learning/deep learning techniques to extract features of multispectral satellite images such as
buildings, vegetation, water bodies etc. The satellite images were acquired from USGS Earth
explorer website. After pre-processing of downloaded data, images were classified into 5 land
use classes namely Farmland, Water bodies, Buildings, Vegetation and Highway, to form
labelled dataset for model training. Further accuracies of different deep learning models used
in the study were compared for different multispectral data.
